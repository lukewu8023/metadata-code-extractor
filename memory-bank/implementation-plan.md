# Metadata Code Extractor - Implementation Plan (Agent-Driven Orchestration)

## Project Goal
To develop an intelligent metadata extraction system that uses an LLM Orchestrator Agent to scan code and documentation, identify metadata gaps, and iteratively fill those gaps using a combination of semantic search and targeted scanning. This plan reflects the validated technology stack.

## Validated Technology Stack

2.  **Completeness Evaluator** (Initial Version - based on `completeness-evaluator-design.md`)
    *   Completeness criteria definition and gap identification
    *   MetadataGap node creation and prioritization
3.  **Orchestration Workflow** (Initial)
    *   Main sequence: Code Scan → Doc Scan → Evaluation → Gap Resolution Loop

4.  **Refined Agent Reasoning**
    *   Advanced prompts and error handling
5.  **Performance & Scalability**
    *   Query optimization, caching, and batching

### Phase 5: CLI, Testing, and Documentation (4-5 Weeks)
**Objective:** Make the system usable, robust, and well-documented.

**Key Deliverables:**
