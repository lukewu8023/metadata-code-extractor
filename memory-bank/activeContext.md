# Metadata Code Extractor - Active Context

## Current Phase
Ready for Phase 1 Implementation (Post-Technology Validation)

## Project Complexity
Level 3 - Intermediate System

## Current Focus
- Executing Technology Validation Plan (LLM, GraphDB, VectorDB selection and PoCs).
- Preparing for Phase 1 implementation: Core framework and infrastructure setup based on completed designs.

## Key Decisions Made
- LLM-centric approach for metadata extraction (primary method).
- Agent-driven orchestration for workflow management.
- Static analysis as secondary support for structure optimization (if needed).
- Two-tier storage approach (Graph DB + Vector DB).
- Dual scan modes (broad and focused) for both code and documents.
- Chunking strategy for LLM processing (e.g., ~40 lines with overlap, to be refined).
- Pluggable parser architecture for scanners.
- Comprehensive graph schema defined in `graph-schema.md` (including DataEntity, Field, Document, DocumentChunk, MetadataGap).
- **Technology Stack Validated:**
    - LLM Provider: OpenRouter (Primary models: `openai/gpt-4`, `anthropic/claude-3-sonnet`; Validated with: `gpt-4o-mini`)
    - Graph Database: Neo4j v4.4.12 (LTS) (Validated with driver v4.4.12, target v4.4.44)
    - Vector Database: Weaviate v1.24.20 (Validated with client v3.24.2)
    - Configuration: Pydantic, python-dotenv
- **Completed detailed design for all core components:**
    - `llm-orchestrator-agent-design.md`
    - `code-scanner-design.md`
    - `document-scanner-design.md`
    - `completeness-evaluator-design.md`
    - `llm-integration-design.md`
    - `database-integration-design.md`
    - `core-data-models.md`
    - `configuration-management-design.md`
    - `logging-design.md`
    - `testing-strategy.md`
- Project plans (`implementation-plan.md`, `tasks.md`) updated for agent-driven architecture and detailed planning completed.

## Key Decisions Pending
- **Initial Implementation Details (Phase 1):**
    - Specific Python dependency versions for core libraries if not already pinned by validation (e.g. final `openai` client version for OpenRouter).
    - Concrete implementation details for initial `MockLLMAdapter` or first real provider adapter if mock is insufficient for early testing.
    - Initial set of specific code/doc types to target for first pass of scanner development beyond basic Python/Markdown (if any change from current plan).
- **Refinement of Prompt Engineering Strategies:** Based on initial Phase 1 development and testing.
- **Detailed Caching Strategy for LLM Responses:** Specific implementation details for `LLMCache`.

## Recent Progress
- Completed all detailed component design documents.
- Aligned project plans (`implementation-plan.md`, `tasks.md`) with the agent-driven architecture.
- `tasks.md` updated with comprehensive planning details including a Technology Validation Plan.
- **Technology validation completed successfully.**
- `progress.md` updated to reflect completion of design and validation phases.

## Next Priority
1.  **Proceed to Phase 1 Implementation (as per `detailed-implementation-plan.md` and `tasks.md`):**
    *   Initialize Python project structure.
    *   Set up dependency management based on validated technologies.
    *   Implement core configuration management system.
    *   Establish logging framework.
    *   Set up testing infrastructure.
    *   Develop LLM Integration Framework.
    *   Implement Database Interface Definitions and Adapters for Neo4j and Weaviate.
    *   Implement Core Data Models.
    *   Create basic CLI structure.
