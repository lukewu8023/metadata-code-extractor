# Metadata Code Extractor - Active Context

## Current Phase
Ready for Implementation (Post-Planning, Pre-Technology Validation & Phase 1)

## Project Complexity
Level 3 - Intermediate System

## Current Focus
- Executing Technology Validation Plan (LLM, GraphDB, VectorDB selection and PoCs).
- Preparing for Phase 1 implementation: Core framework and infrastructure setup based on completed designs.

## Key Decisions Made
- LLM-centric approach for metadata extraction (primary method).
- Agent-driven orchestration for workflow management.
- Static analysis as secondary support for structure optimization (if needed).
- Two-tier storage approach (Graph DB + Vector DB).
- Dual scan modes (broad and focused) for both code and documents.
- Chunking strategy for LLM processing (e.g., ~40 lines with overlap, to be refined).
- Pluggable parser architecture for scanners.
- Comprehensive graph schema defined in `graph-schema.md` (including DataEntity, Field, Document, DocumentChunk, MetadataGap).
- **Completed detailed design for all core components:**
    - `llm-orchestrator-agent-design.md`
    - `code-scanner-design.md`
    - `document-scanner-design.md`
    - `completeness-evaluator-design.md`
    - `llm-integration-design.md`
    - `database-integration-design.md`
    - `core-data-models.md`
    - `configuration-management-design.md`
    - `logging-design.md`
    - `testing-strategy.md`
- Project plans (`implementation-plan.md`, `tasks.md`) updated for agent-driven architecture and detailed planning completed.

## Key Decisions Pending
- **Technology Validation Specifics:**
    - Final selection of LLM provider and model version (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude 3 Opus/Sonnet).
    - Final selection of Graph Database technology (e.g., Neo4j, Memgraph) and specific client library.
    - Final selection of Vector Database technology (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS, Weaviate) and specific client library/integration approach.
- **Initial Implementation Details (Phase 1):**
    - Specific Python dependency versions for core libraries if not already pinned.
    - Concrete implementation details for initial `MockLLMAdapter` or first real provider adapter.
    - Initial set of specific code/doc types to target for first pass of scanner development beyond basic Python/Markdown (if any change from current plan).

## Recent Progress
- Completed all detailed component design documents.
- Aligned project plans (`implementation-plan.md`, `tasks.md`) with the agent-driven architecture.
- `tasks.md` updated with comprehensive planning details including a Technology Validation Plan.
- `progress.md` updated to reflect completion of design phase and current focus on technology validation.

## Next Priority
1.  **Execute Technology Validation Plan (from `tasks.md`):**
    *   Finalize selection of LLM, GraphDB, and VectorDB technologies.
    *   Document chosen technologies.
    *   Create minimal Proofs of Concept (PoCs) for each.
    *   Verify build process and add dependencies.
    *   Validate base configurations for PoCs.
2.  **If Technology Validation is successful, proceed to Phase 1 Implementation (as per `tasks.md`):**
    *   Initialize Python project structure.
    *   Set up dependency management.
    *   Implement core configuration management system.
