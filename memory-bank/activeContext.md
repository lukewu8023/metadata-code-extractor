# Active Context - Metadata Code Extractor

## Current Phase
Planning

## Project Complexity
Level 3 - Intermediate System

## Current Focus
- Detailed architecture design for LLM-augmented metadata extraction
- Graph schema implementation for DataEntity and Field nodes
- Component interfaces definition
- Implementation planning

## Key Decisions Made
- Two-tier storage approach (Graph DB + Vector DB)
- Hybrid approach combining static analysis and LLM processing
- Dual scan modes (broad and focused)
- Chunking strategy (~40 lines with overlap)
- Pluggable parser architecture
- LLM prompt-based extraction is required
- Graph schema with DataEntity and Field node types

## Key Decisions Pending
- Specific LLM provider selection and API integration approach
- Prompt template design for different extraction tasks
- Specific graph and vector database implementations
- Detailed chunking algorithm implementation
- Exact parser implementation for initial language support
- Context window management for LLM processing

## Recent Progress
- Updated project brief with detailed requirements
- Created system architecture overview
- Defined component breakdown and interfaces
- Developed comprehensive implementation plan
- Designed draft metadata schema aligned with graph requirements

## Next Priority
- Set up project structure and environment
- Define LLM prompt templates for key extraction tasks
- Begin parser implementation
- Design detailed component interfaces
