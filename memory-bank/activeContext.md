# Metadata Code Extractor - Active Context

## Current Phase
Planning

## Project Complexity
Level 3 - Intermediate System

## Current Focus
- Detailed architecture design for LLM-based metadata extraction
- LLM prompt template design for code parsing and analysis
- Parser interface design for LLM integration
- Graph schema implementation for DataEntity and Field nodes
- Component interfaces definition
- Implementation planning

## Key Decisions Made
- LLM-centric approach for metadata extraction (primary method)
- Static analysis as secondary support for structure optimization
- Two-tier storage approach (Graph DB + Vector DB)
- Dual scan modes (broad and focused)
- Chunking strategy (~40 lines with overlap)
- Pluggable parser architecture
- Graph schema with DataEntity and Field node types

## Key Decisions Pending
- Specific LLM provider selection and API integration approach
- Finalized prompt templates for different extraction tasks
- Specific graph and vector database implementations
- Detailed chunking algorithm implementation
- Error handling and retry logic for LLM responses
- Context window management for optimal LLM processing

## Recent Progress
- Updated project brief with detailed requirements
- Created system architecture overview
- Defined component breakdown and interfaces
- Developed comprehensive implementation plan
- Updated architecture to emphasize LLM-based parsing
- Designed draft prompt templates for key extraction tasks
- Outlined LLM-based parser implementation approach

## Next Priority
- Finalize LLM prompt templates for extraction tasks
- Design detailed LLM-based parser interfaces
- Set up project structure and environment
- Define metadata schema
- Begin implementing parser interface
