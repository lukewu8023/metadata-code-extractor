# Project Plan Summary - Metadata Code Extractor (Agent-Driven Orchestration)

## Project Complexity
**Level 3 - Intermediate System**: This project involves multiple interconnected components, complex data processing workflows, integration with external systems (graph and vector databases), and LLM-based semantic extraction.

## Requirements Analysis Summary
The primary requirement is to develop an intelligent metadata extraction system. This system will utilize an LLM Orchestrator Agent to:
1.  Scan code repositories and associated documentation.
2.  Extract detailed metadata, focusing on data attribute lineage, relationships, and contextual information.
3.  Identify "MetadataGaps" where information is missing or incomplete.
4.  Iteratively fill these gaps using a combination of semantic search (via Vector DB) and targeted re-scanning of code/documents.
5.  Store structured metadata in a Graph DB and document/code embeddings in a Vector DB.

## Key Components Affected
The system comprises several newly developed, interconnected components:
*   **LLM Orchestrator Agent:** Core decision-making and workflow management.
*   **Code Metadata Scanner:** For processing source code.
*   **Document Scanner:** For processing documentation.
*   **Completeness Evaluator:** For identifying metadata gaps.
*   **LLM Integration Framework:** Generic client, prompt management, caching.
*   **Database Integration Layer:** Interfaces for Graph DB and Vector DB.
*   **Core Data Models:** Pydantic models for all data interchange.
*   **Configuration Management System.**
*   **Logging System.**
*   **CLI.**

## Architecture Considerations
*   **Agent-Driven Orchestration:** An LLM-based agent (LLM Orchestrator Agent) will manage the entire workflow, employing a ReAct (Reason-Act) pattern.
*   **Modular Design:** Components (Scanners, Evaluator, DB Integrations) are designed to be modular with clear interfaces.
*   **Dual Database System:**
    *   Graph Database: For storing structured metadata, relationships, and gaps (schema defined in `graph-schema.md`).
    *   Vector Database: For storing embeddings of code and document chunks to support semantic search.
*   **LLM-Powered Extraction and Reasoning:** LLMs will be used for parsing code/documents, extracting metadata, and powering the agent's decision-making.
*   **Iterative Gap Filling:** The system will iteratively identify and attempt to resolve metadata gaps.
*   **Extensibility:** Design should allow for adding support for new languages, document formats, and completeness rules.

## Dependencies
*   **Python 3.9+ Environment.**
*   **LLM Provider:** OpenRouter API for access to multiple LLM models (GPT-4, Claude-3, etc.). **SELECTED**
*   **Graph Database:** Neo4j v4.4.44 (LTS) for storing structured metadata and relationships. **SELECTED**
*   **Vector Database:** Weaviate v1.24.20 for storing embeddings and semantic search. **SELECTED**
*   **Python Libraries:** As defined in `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt` (e.g., Pydantic, Click, HTTP clients).

## Potential Challenges & Mitigations
*   **LLM Access & Performance:**
    *   Challenge: Reliable access to LLM API, potential latency/rate limits.
    *   Mitigation: Caching, batching, efficient prompting, configurable retry mechanisms.
*   **Prompt Engineering Complexity:**
    *   Challenge: Crafting effective and robust prompts for diverse extraction and reasoning tasks.
    *   Mitigation: Iterative development, versioning of prompts, dedicated evaluation, modular prompt design.
*   **Data Variety & Complexity:**
    *   Challenge: Handling diverse coding languages, documentation formats, and project structures.
    *   Mitigation: Start with a focused set (e.g., Python, Markdown), design for extensibility, use LLM flexibility.
*   **Accuracy and Non-Determinism of LLMs:**
    *   Challenge: LLM-based extraction may not be 100% accurate and can be non-deterministic.
    *   Mitigation: Confidence scoring, validation rules, targeted re-scans, allowing human review flags, designing prompts for structured output.
*   **Scalability for Large Repositories:**
    *   Challenge: Processing very large codebases and document sets efficiently.
    *   Mitigation: Optimize critical paths, efficient chunking, consider asynchronous processing where applicable, batch DB operations.
*   **Integration Complexity:**
    *   Challenge: Ensuring smooth interaction between multiple components (Agent, Scanners, DBs).
    *   Mitigation: Clear API contracts (defined in design docs), thorough integration testing.

## Creative Phase Components
Based on the design, the following areas involve significant design decisions and will benefit from or require creative approaches during implementation:
*   **LLM Orchestrator Agent Reasoning Logic:** Designing the ReAct prompts and decision-making framework for the agent.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting and refining LLM prompts for all scanners, the evaluator, and the agent itself. This is an ongoing creative process.
*   **Completeness Rules Definition:** Designing the initial and subsequent sets of rules for the `CompletenessEvaluator`.
*   **Gap Resolution Strategies:** Developing diverse and effective strategies for the agent to fill different types of metadata gaps.
