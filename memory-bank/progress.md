## Completed Tasks
- Initial Memory Bank structure review
- Updated project brief with detailed requirements for agent-driven architecture
- Created system orchestration architecture document (`orchestration-architecture.md`)
- Updated graph schema (`graph-schema.md`) for documents, chunks, and gaps
- Developed comprehensive 5-phase implementation plan (`implementation-plan.md`) for agent-driven approach
- Outlined high-level component interactions (LLM Agent, Scanners, Evaluator, DBs)

## In Progress
- Detailed design for LLM Orchestrator Agent interface and logic.
- Detailed design for Document Scanner interface and capabilities.
- Detailed design for Completeness Evaluator rules and logic.
- Gap resolution strategy refinement (semantic search, targeted scans).
- Selection of specific LLM provider and DB technologies for initial implementation.
- Configuration system design details.
- Initial test strategy and test case identification for Phase 1 & 2 components.

## Blocked Items
- Core implementation (pending finalization of detailed designs for Phase 1 components).
- Testing environment setup (pending finalization of tech stack choices).

## Next Development Steps (Corresponds to start of Implementation Plan - Phase 1)
1.  **Finalize selection of LLM provider and Graph/Vector DB technologies.**
2.  **Set up Python project structure, dependency management, and version control.**
3.  **Implement the core configuration management system.**
4.  **Establish the logging framework for the project.**
5.  **Set up the testing infrastructure (e.g., `pytest`).**
6.  **Develop the generic LLM client interface and an adapter for the chosen provider.**
7.  **Define and implement the abstract interfaces for Graph DB and Vector DB interactions.**
8.  **Implement initial Pydantic models for core data structures.**
9.  **Begin detailed design and then implementation of Code Scanner (initial version) as per Phase 2.**
