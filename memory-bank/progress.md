## Completed Tasks
- Initial Memory Bank structure review
- Updated project brief with detailed requirements for agent-driven architecture
- Created system orchestration architecture document (`orchestration-architecture.md`)
- Updated graph schema (`graph-schema.md`) for documents, chunks, and gaps
- Developed comprehensive 5-phase implementation plan (`implementation-plan.md`) for agent-driven approach
- Outlined high-level component interactions (LLM Agent, Scanners, Evaluator, DBs)
- Detailed design for LLM Orchestrator Agent interface and logic (`llm-orchestrator-agent-design.md`)
- Detailed design for Code Metadata Scanner (`code-scanner-design.md`)
- Detailed design for Document Scanner interface and capabilities (`document-scanner-design.md`)
- Detailed design for Completeness Evaluator rules and logic (`completeness-evaluator-design.md`)
- Detailed design for LLM Integration (`llm-integration-design.md`)
- Detailed design for Database Integration (`database-integration-design.md`)
- Detailed design for Core Data Models (`core-data-models.md`)
- Detailed design for Configuration Management (`configuration-management-design.md`)
- Detailed design for Logging (`logging-design.md`)
- Detailed design for Testing Strategy (`testing-strategy.md`)

## In Progress
- Technology Validation Plan:
    - Finalize selection of specific LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) and specific model versions.
    - Finalize selection of specific Graph DB (e.g., Neo4j, Memgraph).
    - Finalize selection of specific Vector DB (e.g., Chroma, FAISS, Weaviate).
    - Document chosen technologies.
    - Create Minimal Proofs of Concept (PoCs) for LLM, GraphDB, VectorDB.
    - Verify build process and required dependencies for chosen tech.
    - Validate base configurations for chosen tech.

## Blocked Items
- Phase 1 Implementation (pending completion of Technology Validation).

## Next Development Steps (Post Technology Validation)
1.  **Project Setup & Environment (as per Phase 1 in `tasks.md`):**
    *   Initialize Python project structure (`metadata_code_extractor/` and subdirectories).
    *   Set up dependency management (e.g., `pyproject.toml` with chosen libraries).
2.  **Implement core configuration management system** (as per `configuration-management-design.md`).
3.  **Establish the logging framework** (as per `logging-design.md`).
4.  **Set up the testing infrastructure** (`pytest`, initial structure as per `testing-strategy.md`).
5.  **Develop LLM Integration Framework (as per `llm-integration-design.md`):**
    *   Implement `LLMClient` interface.
    *   Implement `LLMProviderAdapter` for the chosen LLM provider.
    *   Implement basic `PromptManager`.
    *   Implement initial `LLMCache`.
6.  **Implement Database Interface Definitions (as per `database-integration-design.md`):**
    *   Implement `GraphDBInterface` adapter for the chosen Graph DB.
    *   Implement `VectorDBInterface` adapter for the chosen Vector DB.
7.  **Implement Core Data Models (as per `core-data-models.md` and `tasks.md` Phase 1).**
8.  **Implement Basic CLI Structure (as per `tasks.md` Phase 1).**
