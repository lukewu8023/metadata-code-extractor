- Technology Validation Execution completed successfully:
  - Configuration Management: ✅ PASS
  - LLM Provider (OpenRouter): ✅ PASS 
  - Graph Database (Neo4j): ✅ PASS
  - Vector Database (Weaviate): ✅ PASS
  - All technology selections confirmed as viable

## In Progress
- Phase 1: Core Framework and Infrastructure Development:
    - Ready to begin implementation with validated technology stack
    - OpenRouter (LLM), Neo4j (Graph DB), Weaviate (Vector DB) confirmed working

## Blocked Items
- None (Technology Validation completed successfully)

## Next Development Steps (Phase 1 Implementation)
1.  **Project Setup & Environment (as per Phase 1 in `detailed-implementation-plan.md` and `tasks.md`):**
    *   Initialize Python project structure (`metadata_code_extractor/` and subdirectories as defined in `project-structure.md`).
    *   Set up dependency management (e.g., `pyproject.toml` with validated libraries: `python-dotenv`, `pydantic`, `requests`, `openai` (for OpenRouter), `neo4j==4.4.12`, `weaviate-client==3.24.2`).
2.  **Implement core configuration management system** (as per `configuration-management-design.md` and validated `config_poc.py`).
3.  **Establish the logging framework** (as per `logging-design.md`).
4.  **Set up the testing infrastructure** (`pytest`, initial structure as per `testing-strategy.md`).
5.  **Develop LLM Integration Framework (as per `llm-integration-design.md` and validated `llm_poc.py`):**
    *   Implement `LLMClient` interface.
    *   Implement `LLMProviderAdapter` for OpenRouter.
    *   Implement basic `PromptManager` (loading from `prompts/` directory).
    *   Implement initial `LLMCache`.
6.  **Implement Database Interface Definitions and Adapters (as per `database-integration-design.md` and validated PoCs):**
    *   Implement `GraphDBInterface` adapter for Neo4j (`neo4j_adapter.py`).
    *   Implement `VectorDBInterface` adapter for Weaviate (`weaviate_adapter.py`).
7.  **Implement Core Data Models (as per `core-data-models.md` and `tasks.md` Phase 1).**
8.  **Implement Basic CLI Structure (as per `project-structure.md` and `tasks.md` Phase 1).**
