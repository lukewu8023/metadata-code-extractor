## Completed Tasks
- Initial Memory Bank structure
- Updated project brief with detailed requirements
- Created system architecture overview
- Defined component breakdown and interfaces
- Developed comprehensive implementation plan
- Updated architecture to emphasize LLM-based parsing approach
- Designed detailed LLM-based parser interfaces
- Created detailed interface designs for all major components
- Defined comprehensive graph schema for metadata storage
- Developed prompt engineering guide with templates and optimization techniques
- Designed project structure and directory organization
- Outlined implementation roadmap with phases and timelines

## In Progress
- LLM-based parser interface design
- LLM prompt system design
- LLM provider selection and integration approach
- Configuration system design
- Testing strategy development

## Blocked Items
- Implementation (waiting for final design decisions and LLM provider selection)
- Testing (waiting for implementation)

## Next Development Steps
1. Finalize system architecture design
2. Select specific LLM provider for initial implementation
3. Define LLM prompt templates for key extraction tasks
4. Set up project structure and core framework
5. Implement basic LLM client and template system
6. Design detailed LLM-based parser interfaces
7. Define metadata schema
8. Begin parser implementation
