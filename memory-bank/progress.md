  - Graph Database (Neo4j): âœ… PASS
  - Vector Database (Weaviate): âœ… PASS
  - All technology selections confirmed as viable
- Phase 1 Core Infrastructure (Partial):
  - Project structure setup with proper module organization
  - Configuration management system implemented with Pydantic models
  - Logging framework with standard formatters
  - Testing infrastructure with pytest configuration
  - LLM Client interface with 81% test coverage (15/15 tests passing)
  - LLM Provider adapter abstract base class and concrete implementations
  - Prompt manager for template loading and management

## In Progress
- Phase 1: Core Framework and Infrastructure Development:
    - Project structure setup completed
    - Configuration management system implemented
    - Logging framework implemented  
    - Testing infrastructure established
    - LLM Client interface completed (81% test coverage)
    - Remaining: Database interfaces, Core data models, CLI structure

## Blocked Items
- None (Technology Validation completed successfully)

## Next Development Steps (Phase 1 Remaining)
1.  **Complete LLM Integration Framework:**
    *   Implement `LLMCache` (in-memory or file-based)
    *   Implement concrete provider adapters (OpenRouter)
2.  **Database Interface Definitions:**
    *   Define `GraphDBInterface` abstract base class
    *   Define `VectorDBInterface` abstract base class  
    *   Define common DB-related Pydantic models
3.  **Core Data Models:**
    *   Implement extraction models (`ExtractedDataEntity`, `ExtractedField`, etc.)
    *   Implement metadata gap models (`MetadataGapInfo`, `ScanReport`)
4.  **Basic CLI Structure:**
    *   Implement initial CLI using `click` with basic commands 

## CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

**Project Phase:** Phase 1 - Core Framework and Infrastructure (In Progress)
