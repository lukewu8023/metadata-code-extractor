## In Progress
- Phase 1: Core Framework and Infrastructure Development (Final 10%):
    - Database interface definitions (GraphDBInterface, VectorDBInterface)
    - Core data models for extraction (ExtractedDataEntity, MetadataGap, etc.)
    - Basic CLI implementation with initial commands

## Blocked Items
- None (Technology Validation completed successfully)

## Next Development Steps (Phase 1 Remaining)
1.  **Complete LLM Integration Framework:**
    *   Implement `LLMCache` (in-memory or file-based)
2.  **Database Interface Definitions:**
    *   Define `GraphDBInterface` abstract base class
    *   Define `VectorDBInterface` abstract base class  
    *   Define common DB-related Pydantic models
3.  **Core Data Models:**
    *   Implement extraction models (`ExtractedDataEntity`, `ExtractedField`, etc.)
    *   Implement metadata gap models (`MetadataGapInfo`, `ScanReport`)
4.  **Basic CLI Structure:**
    *   Implement initial CLI using `click` with basic commands
