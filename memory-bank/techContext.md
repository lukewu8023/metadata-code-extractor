# Technical Context - Metadata Code Extractor

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Core Libraries**:
  - AST/lib2to3/libCST for Python code parsing
  - Tree-sitter for multi-language parsing
  - LangChain or similar for LLM integration
  - NetworkX for relationship graphing
  - FAISS or similar for vector embeddings
  - SQLite/PostgreSQL for symbol indexing
  - Optional Neo4j connector for graph database output
- **LLM Integration**: 
  - OpenAI API or similar for code analysis
  - Prompt engineering system for metadata extraction
  - Context window management for code chunks

## Technical Components
1. **Code Parser**
   - Multi-language support through pluggable parsers
   - Abstract syntax tree generation and traversal
   - Comment extraction and processing

2. **Symbol Indexer**
   - Fast lookup tables for code symbols
   - File and line position tracking
   - Dependency mapping

3. **Semantic Chunker**
   - Code chunking with appropriate overlap
   - Embedding generation
   - Vector storage integration

4. **Metadata Extractor**
   - Entity identification (classes, functions, fields)
   - Relationship detection 
   - Type and validation rule extraction
   - Transformation logic identification
   - LLM-based semantic extraction
   - Graph schema mapping

5. **Output Formatter**
   - Structured metadata generation (JSON/dict)
   - Graph database compatible output
   - Vector database compatible chunks

6. **LLM Prompt System**
   - Templated prompts for different extraction tasks
   - Context window optimization
   - Response parsing and validation
   - Error handling and retry logic

## Graph Schema Implementation
The system will map extracted code elements to a specific graph schema with two primary node types:

1. **Data Entity nodes** for collections of data:
   - Mapped from classes, tables, structs, or data structures in code
   - Properties include name, type, and description
   - Connected to Field nodes via HAS_FIELD relationships
   - Lineage tracked via DERIVED_FROM and FEEDS_INTO relationships

2. **Field nodes** for individual data attributes:
   - Mapped from class attributes, struct fields, table columns
   - Properties include name, data_type, nullable, description
   - Connected to entities via BELONGS_TO relationship
   - Field transformations tracked via TRANSFORMED_FROM/TRANSFORMED_INTO

## Technical Challenges
- Handling multiple programming languages with consistent output
- Balancing between static analysis and LLM-based extraction
- Efficient chunking strategies for optimal semantic search
- Designing consistent metadata schema across languages
- Managing large codebases without hitting token limits
- Detecting complex relationships across multiple files
- Crafting effective LLM prompts for accurate metadata extraction
- Mapping diverse code patterns to the graph schema

## Integration Points
- Graph database systems (Neo4j, ArangoDB, etc.)
- Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.)
- Language model APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Version control systems (Git)
